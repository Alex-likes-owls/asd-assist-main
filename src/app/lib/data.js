      "There are many misconceptions about ASD, whether it be that the disorder is caused by vacciness or that those who have ASD are sociopaths. Here, I'll debunk some of the most common stereotypes and myths.",
    article:
      "Autism being caused by vaccines is a pervasive myth on the internet. However, this is easily disproven with the wealth of scientific research on the disorder, proving that you are born with the disorder and cannot get it later in life. Another popular myth is that all autistic individuals show the same symptoms and act the same. Autism is a spectrum, so some people exhibit some characteristics more and some less. Thirdly, the autistic sociopath stereotype. Contrary to what the media shows, autistic individuals are capable of feeling empathy. Some individuals even have hyper-empathy. Autism is a neurological variation rather than a disease, so it does not have a 'cure.' People may act more 'normal' as they grow up, but the condition will remain. Lastly, not all autistic individuals are geniuses or have intellectual disabilities. Savant syndrome, or when a person possesses extraordinary abilities, is rare to occur, and the same could be said for intellectual disabilities as well. Each autistic person is different, so one cannot form an opinion on them as a whole because of a single person.",

      "Are hyperfixations simply a fancy name for obsessions, and are they exclusively an ASD thing? With social media popularizing the word, it's hard to tell. However, would you believe me if I said it's neither?",
    article:
      " Hyperfixations are defined as when an individual shows interest in a chosen object, activity, or person for a prolonged period to an extreme degree. Individuals may use hyperfixations to cope with negative emotions as they relish learning more about their chosen thing. For example, a person may spend time learning about their favorite characters in a show instead of doing schoolwork. Eating the same meals for a long time can be considered a hyperfixation as you hyperfixate on the dish. You may think that hyperfixations are simply obsessions with a fancier name, but you would be wrong, as these two have two distinct differences. Hyperfixations come in waves and are enjoyable, whereas obsessions are not. A person may spend days eating the same meal, but one day, they might not like it anymore, and after some time, they might begin to like it again and hyperfixate on it as they enjoy eating the food. However, this would not be the same for obsessions, as the individual would not get the same joy and may think they 'have to' eat the meal. Hyperfixatons are also not exclusive to neurodivergents as neurotypicals experience them too.",

      "Some believe stimming to only be hand-flapping or leg boucing, but in reality, stimming can come in many different forms. There's even different types of stimming, and neurotypical people stim too!",
    article:
      "Stimming, or self-stimulatory behavior, is when a person engages in repetitive movements or sounds to regulate emotions. These behaviors can range from hand-flapping, and rocking to vocal souds. While stimming is associated with individuals on the autism spectrum, it should be known that neurotypical people also engage in stimming behaviors, though less noticeably. For example, bouncing one's leg, whistling, or chewing on pens and nails. Just like with neurodivergent people, stimming in neurotypical people often helps manage stress, anxiety, and excessive energy, and thus providing a means of self-soothing. Stimming is a natural and beneficial response to emotional or sensory overload, and it is not at all inherently harmful. When stimming begins to hurt others or the person doing it, interventions may be taken to assist the individual to remain safe. In conclusion, stimming is a behavior that everyone engages in from time to time, and it should be understood as a helpful way for individuals to regulate their emotional or sensory input. ",

    article:
      "Alexithymia is a condition defined as having difficulty identifying, understanding, and expressing emotions. Individuals with alexithymia often find it challenging to identify and describe their feelings, which can lead to miscommunication and difficulty in forming bonds with others. While alexithymia is usually associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it is not by any means exclusive to it. Many people with other conditions, such as depression, anxiety, or trauma-related disorders like PTSD, also experience alexithymia. There are two primary types of alexithymia: primary and secondary. Primary alexithymia is believed to be a trait-based condition, where individuals have inherent difficulties with emotional awareness and processing. This form is often linked to neurodevelopmental conditions like ASD. In contrast, secondary alexithymia is typically a response to psychological stress or trauma, where individuals may develop difficulties with emotional recognition after experiencing something incredibly traumatizing. While alexithymia cannot be cured, therapy may help them understand their emotions more.",

      "Dyspraxia, also known as developmental coordination disorder (DCD), is a neurological condition that affects motor skills and coordination. Individuals with dyspraxia may struggle with tasks that require physical coordination, such as writing, tying shoes, or sports in general. This can lead to challenges in daily activities, which sometimes leads to them getting bullied over not being able to do a 'simple' task. Dyspraxia is often associated with individuals on the autism spectrum, as both conditions can involve difficulties with motor skills, coordination, and spatial awareness. However, like alexithymia, dyspraxia is not exclusive to ASD as the condition can be present in individuals who are neurotypical. Those who struggle with processing sensory input, and fine and gross motor skills may face additional difficulties that can impact their self-esteem and social interactions.",

    article:
      "Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often experience heightened or diminished sensitivity to textures, which can affect various their daily lives greatly. For example, some individuals may be hypersensitive to certain food textures, such as the softness of mashed potatoes, the skin of fruits, or the crunchiness of chips. This can make it difficult to have a balanced diet. Conversely, some individuals with ASD may be hyposensitive and actively seek out specific textures, such as 'crunchy' foods. Moreover, clothing choices may be affected due to texture issues. Fabrics like wool and certain seams or tags in clothing can cause extreme irritation and discomfort for individuals with ASD. They might avoid wearing certain clothes or prefer soft, smooth materials like cotton to avoid a sensory overload. Unfortunately, these sensitivities may result in a person with ASD feeling alienated for struggling with seemingly inconsequential things.",
